My implementeation of the math expalined on the EDX course LAFF: https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-frontiers-utaustinx-ut-5-02x

This is a work in progress and by no means production ready, no consideration at all has been done for the performance side of thing. For now the operations are pure python, and python doesn't play so nice with "references".
Probably if someone wants performance on this kind of approach would probably write this in c++ and expose that as py api.
